An impulse is a signal composed of all zeros, except a single nonzero point. In effect, impulse decomposition provides a way to analyze signals one sample at a time. The previous chapter also presented the fundamental concept of DSP: the input signal is decomposed into simple additive components, each of these components is passed through a linear system, and the resulting output components are synthesized (added). The signal resulting from this divide-and-conquer procedure is identical to that obtained by directly passing the original signal through the system. While many different decompositions are possible, two form the backbone of signal processing: impulse decomposition and Fourier decomposition. When impulse decomposition is used, the procedure can be described by a mathematical operation called convolution. In this chapter (and most of the following ones) we will only be dealing with discrete signals. Convolution also applies to continuous signals, but the mathematics is more complicated. We will look at how continious signals are processed in Chapter 13.</span></span>

<span key="e6a07977674f456796aeb95438be6937"><span offset-key="e6a07977674f456796aeb95438be6937:0">Figure 6-1 defines two important terms used in DSP. The first is the delta function, symbolized by the Greek letter delta, Î´\[n\]. The delta function is a normalized impulse, that is, sample number zero has a value of one, while all other samples have a value of zero. For this reason, the delta function is frequently called the unit impulse.</span></span>

<span key="2b91fdea2da94d3383feb5c6b46ec59c"><span offset-key="2b91fdea2da94d3383feb5c6b46ec59c:0">The second term defined in Fig. 6-1 is the impulse response. As the name suggests, the impulse response is the signal that exits a system when a delta function (unit impulse) is the input. If two systems are different in any way, they will have different impulse responses. Just as the input and output signals are often called x\[n\] and y\[n\], the impulse response is usually given the symbol, h\[n\] . Of course, this can be changed if a more descriptive name is available, for instance, f\[n\] might be used to identify the impulse response of a filter.</span></span>

<span key="12ada511954f4e29b39bc135c829feb2"><span offset-key="12ada511954f4e29b39bc135c829feb2:0">Any impulse can be represented as a shifted and scaled delta function. Consider a signal, a\[n\], composed of all zeros except sample number 8, which has a value of -3. This is the same as a delta function shifted to the right by 8 samples, and multiplied by -3. In equation form: a\[n\] = -3Î´\[n-8\]. Make sure you understand this notation, it is used in nearly all DSP equations.</span></span>

This is where the properties of homogeneity and shift invariance are used. Scaling and shifting the input results in an identical scaling and shifting of the output. If Î´\[n\] results in h\[n\], it follows that -3Î´\[n-8\] results in -3h\[n-8\]. In words, the output is a version of the impulse response that has been shifted and scaled by the same amount as the delta function on the input. If you know a system's impulse response, you immediately know how it will react to any impulse.</span></span>

First, the input signal can be decomposed into a set of impulses, each of which can be viewed as a scaled and shifted delta function. Second, the output resulting from each impulse is a scaled and shifted version of the impulse response. Third, the overall output signal can be found by adding these scaled and shifted impulse responses. In other words, if we know a system's impulse response, then we can calculate what the output will be for any possible input signal. This means we know everything about the system. There is nothing more that can be learned about a linear system's characteristics. (However, in later chapters we will show that this information can be represented in different forms).</span></span>

If the system being considered is a filter, the impulse response is called the filter kernel, the convolution kernel, or simply, the kernel. In image processing, the impulse response is called the point spread function. While these terms are used in slightly different ways, they all mean the same thing, the signal produced by a system when the input is a delta function.</span></span>

Expressed in words, the input signal convolved with the impulse response is equal to the output signal. Just as addition is represented by the plus, +, and multiplication by the cross, Ã—, convolution is represented by the star, \*. It is unfortunate that most programming languages also use the star to indicate multiplication.

In mathematical terms, x\[n\] is convolved with h\[n\] to produce y\[n\]. This first viewpoint of convolution is based on the fundamental concept of DSP: decompose the input, pass the components through the system, and synthesize the output. In this example, each of the nine samples in the input signal will contribute a scaled and shifted version of the impulse response to the output signal. These nine signals are shown in Fig. 6-6. Adding these nine signals produces the output signal, y\[n\].</span></span>

When the signal is decomposed, this turns into an impulse represented as: 1.4Î´\[n-4\]. After passing through the system, the resulting output component will be: 1.4h\[n-4\]. This signal is shown in the center box of the nine signals in Fig. 6-6. Notice that this is the impulse response, h\[n\], multiplied by 1.4, and shifted four samples to the right. Zeros have been added at samples 0-3 and at samples 8-11 to serve as place holders. To make this more clear, Fig. 6-6 uses squares to represent the data points that come from the shifted and scaled impulse response, and diamonds for the added zeros.</span></span>

Place holding zeros have been added at points 0-7. Lastly, examine the effect of points x\[0\] and x\[7\].

The output signal in Fig. 6-7 is identical to the output signal in Fig. 6-5. This isn't a mistake, but an important property. Convolution is commutative: a\[n\]\*b\[n\] = b\[n\]\*a\[n\]. The mathematics does not care which is the input signal and which is the impulse response, only that two signals are convolved with each other. Although the mathematics may allow it, exchanging the two signals has no physical meaning in system theory. The input signal and impulse response are two totally different things and exchanging them doesn't make sense. What the commutative property provides is a mathematical tool for manipulating equations to achieve various results.</span></span>

If this were the only action taken by the inner loop, line 240 could be written, Y\[J%\] = X\[40\]âœ³H\[J%\]. Second, the scaled impulse is shifted 40 samples to the right by adding this number to the index used in the output signal. This second action would change line 240 to: Y\[40+J%\] = X\[40\]\*H\[J%\]. Third, Y\[ \] must accumulate (synthesize) all the signals resulting from each sample in the input signal. Therefore, the new information must be added to the information that is already in the array. This results in the final command: Y\[40+J%\] = Y\[40+J%\] + X\[40\]\*H\[J%\].

In this second viewpoint, we reverse this by looking at individual samples in the output signal, and finding the contributing points from the input. This is important from both mathematical and practical standpoints. Suppose that we are given some input signal and impulse response, and want to find the convolution of the two. The most straightforward method would be to write a program that loops through the output signal, calculating one sample on each loop cycle. Likewise, equations are written in the form: y\[n\] = some combination of other variables. That is, sample n in the output signal is equal to some combination of the many values in the input signal and impulse response. This requires a knowledge of how each sample in the output signal can be calculated independently of all other samples in the output signal.

Now, look closely at these nine output components and identify which can affect y\[6\]. That is, find which of these nine signals contains a nonzero sample at the sixth position. Five of the output components only have added zeros (the diamond markers) at the sixth sample, and can therefore be ignored. Only four of the output components are capable of having a nonzero value in the sixth position. These are the output components generated from the input samples: x\[3\], x\[4\], x\[5\] and x\[6\]. By adding the sixth sample from each of these output components, y\[6\] is determined as: y\[6\] = x\[3\]h\[3\] + x\[4\]h\[2\] + x\[5\]h\[1\] + x\[6\]h\[0\]. That is, four samples from the input signal are multiplied by the four samples in the impulse response, and the products added.</span></span>

The convolution machine is positioned so that its output is aligned with the output sample being calculated. Four samples from the input signal fall into the inputs of the convolution machine. These values are multiplied by the indicated samples in the impulse response, and the products are added. This produces the value for the output signal, which drops into its proper place.

If the impulse response is M points in length, the first and last M-1 samples in the output signal are based on less information than the samples between. This is analogous to an electronic circuit requiring a certain amount of time to stabilize after the power is applied. The difference is that this transient is easy to ignore in electronics, but very prominent in DSP.</span></span>

This calls for a high-pass filter, such as the impulse response shown in the figure. The problem is, the first and last 30 points are a mess! The shape of these end regions can be understood by imagining the input signal padded with 30 zeros on the left side, samples x\[-1\] through x\[-30\], and 30 zeros on the right, samples x\[81\] through x\[110\]. The output signal can then be viewed as a filtered version of this longer waveform. These "end effect" problems are widespread in DSP.

It allows each point in the output signal to be calculated independently of all other points in the output signal. The index, i, determines which sample in the output signal is being calculated, and therefore corresponds to the left-right position of the convolution machine. In computer programs performing convolution, a loop makes this index run through each sample in the output signal. To calculate one of the output samples, the index, j, is used inside of the convolution machine. As j runs through 0 to M-1, each sample in the impulse response, h\[j\], is multiplied by the proper sample from the input signal, x\[i-j\]. All these products are added to produce the output sample being calculated. Study Eq. 6-1 until you fully understand how it is implemented by the convolution machine.

The value of Y\[I%\] is set to zero in line 190, allowing it to accumulate the products inside of the convolution machine. The FOR-NEXT loop in lines 200 to 240 provide a direct implementation of Eq. 6-2. The index, J%, steps through each</span></span>

Line 230 provides the multiplication of each sample in the impulse response, H\[J%\], with the appropriate sample from the input signal, X\[I%-J%\], and adds the result to the accumulator.</span></span>

Lines 210 and 220 prevent this from being outside the defined array, X\[0\] to X\[80\]. In other words, this program handles undefined samples in the input signal by ignoring them. Another alternative would be to define the input signal's array from X\[-30\] to X\[110\], allowing 30 zeros to be padded on each side of the true data. As a third alternative, the FOR-NEXT loop in line 180 could be changed to run from 30 to 80, rather than 0 to 110. That is, the program would only calculate the samples in the output signal where the impulse response is fully immersed in the input signal. The important thing is that you must use one of these three techniques. If you don't, the program will crash when it tries to read the out-of-bounds data.</span></span>
