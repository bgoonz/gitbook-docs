<span key="8ad55b8439564745b803b8e14fa8ffdd"><span offset-key="8ad55b8439564745b803b8e14fa8ffdd:0">Whenever an electric voltage exists between two separated conductors, an electric field is present within the space between those conductors. In basic electronics, we study the interactions of voltage, current, and resistance as they pertain to circuits, which are conductive paths through which electrons may travel. When we talk about fields, however, we're dealing with interactions that can be spread across empty space.</span></span>

<span key="c988b6d7aa99482e9716edd2f4747faa"><span offset-key="c988b6d7aa99482e9716edd2f4747faa:0">Admittedly, the concept of a "field" is somewhat abstract. At least with electric current it isn't too difficult to envision tiny particles called electrons moving their way between the nuclei of atoms within a conductor, but a "field" doesn't even have mass, and need not exist within matter at all.</span></span>

<span key="5d927eaea9124cdbb17307d3b308e4cb"><span offset-key="5d927eaea9124cdbb17307d3b308e4cb:0">Despite its abstract nature, almost every one of us has direct experience with fields, at least in the form of magnets. Have you ever played with a pair of magnets, noticing how they attract or repel each other depending on their relative orientation? There is an undeniable force between a pair of magnets, and this force is without "substance." It has no mass, no color, no odor, and if not for the physical force exerted on the magnets themselves, it would be utterly insensible to our bodies. Physicists describe the interaction of magnets in terms of magnetic fields in the space between them. If iron filings are placed near a magnet, they orient themselves along the lines of the field, visually indicating its presence.</span></span>

<span key="5c40268dbff54b8b95f46537eb4c454e"><span offset-key="5c40268dbff54b8b95f46537eb4c454e:0">The subject of this chapter is electric fields (and devices called capacitors that exploit them), not magnetic fields, but there are many similarities. Most likely you have experienced electric fields as well. Chapter 1 of this book began with an explanation of static electricity, and how materials such as wax and wool -- when rubbed against each other -- produced a physical attraction. Again, physicists would describe this interaction in terms of electric fields generated by the two objects as a result of their electron imbalances. Suffice it to say that whenever a voltage exists between two points, there will be an electric field manifested in the space between those points.</span></span>

The field force is the amount of "push" that a field exerts over a certain distance. The field flux is the total quantity, or effect, of the field through space. Field force and flux are roughly analogous to voltage ("push") and current (flow) through a conductor, respectively, although field flux can exist in totally empty space (without the motion of particles such as electrons) whereas current can only take place where there are free electrons to move. Field flux can be opposed in space, just as the flow of electrons can be opposed by resistance. The amount of field flux that will develop in space is proportional to the amount of field force applied, divided by the amount of opposition to flux. Just as the type of conducting material dictates that conductor's specific resistance to electric current, the type of insulating material separating two conductors dictates the specific opposition to field flux.</span></span>

This is why conductors must be connected together in a circular path (a circuit) for continuous current to occur. Oddly enough, however, extra electrons can be "squeezed" into a conductor without a path to exit if an electric field is allowed to develop in space relative to another conductor. The number of extra free electrons added to the conductor (or free electrons taken away) is directly proportional to the amount of field flux between the two conductors.</span></span>

There are many different styles of capacitor construction, each one suited for particular ratings and purposes. For very small capacitors, two circular plates sandwiching an insulating material will suffice. For larger capacitor values, the "plates" may be strips of metal foil, sandwiched around a flexible insulating medium and rolled up for compactness. The highest capacitance values are obtained by using a microscopic-thickness layer of insulating oxide separating two conductive surfaces. In any case, though, the general idea is the same: two conductors, separated by an insulator.</span></span>

Energy storage in a capacitor is a function of the voltage between the plates, as well as other factors which we will discuss later in this chapter. A capacitor's ability to store energy as a function of voltage (potential difference between the two leads) results in a tendency to try to maintain voltage at a constant level. In other words, capacitors tend to resist changes in voltage drop. When voltage across a capacitor is increased or decreased, the capacitor "resists" the change by drawing current from or supplying current to the source of the voltage change, in opposition to the change.</span></span>

This means that more electrons must be added to the (-) plate and more taken away from the (+) plate, necessitating a current in that direction. Conversely, to release energy from a capacitor, the voltage across it must be decreased. This means some of the excess electrons on the (-) plate must be returned to the (+) plate, necessitating a current in the other direction.</span></span>

Hypothetically, a capacitor left untouched will indefinitely maintain whatever state of voltage charge that its been left it. Only an outside source (or drain) of current can alter the voltage charge stored by a perfect capacitor:</span></span>

The equation tells us that with 0 volts per second change for a dv/dt, there must be zero instantaneous current (i).

According to the equation, this fixed value of dv/dt, multiplied by the capacitor's capacitance in Farads (also fixed), results in a fixed current of some magnitude. From a physical perspective, an increasing voltage across the capacitor demands that there be an increasing charge differential between the plates. Thus, for a slow, steady voltage increase rate, there must be a slow, steady rate of charge building in the capacitor, which equates to a slow, steady flow rate of electrons, or current. In this scenario, the capacitor is acting as a load, with electrons entering the negative plate and exiting the positive, accumulating energy in the electric field.</span></span>

Again, the capacitor will react to this change of voltage by producing a current, but this time the current will be in the opposite direction. A decreasing capacitor voltage requires that the charge differential between the capacitor's plates be reduced, and the only way that can happen is if the electrons reverse their direction of flow, the capacitor discharging rather than charging. In this condition, with electrons exiting the negative plate and entering the positive, the capacitor will act as a source, like a battery, releasing its stored energy to the rest of the circuit.</span></span>

The only difference between the effects of a decreasing voltage and an increasing voltage is the direction of electron flow. For the same rate of voltage change over time, either increasing or decreasing, the current magnitude (amps) will be the same. Mathematically, a decreasing voltage rate-of-change is expressed as a negative dv/dt quantity. Following the formula i = C(dv/dt), this will result in a current figure (i) that is likewise negative in sign, indicating a direction of flow corresponding to discharge of the capacitor.</span></span>

<span key="cafc1c9807c6489eb79846c3fe8bfe16"><span offset-key="cafc1c9807c6489eb79846c3fe8bfe16:0">Capacitors, like all electrical components, have limitations which must be respected for the sake of reliability and proper circuit operation.</span></span>

<span key="5df915854c3644ea820d994298830efa"><span offset-key="5df915854c3644ea820d994298830efa:0">Working voltage: Since capacitors are nothing more than two conductors separated by an insulator (the dielectric), you must pay attention to the maximum voltage allowed across it. If too much voltage is applied, the "breakdown" rating of the dielectric material may be exceeded, resulting in the capacitor internally short-circuiting.</span></span>

<span key="7067927dbaf1421f9d108f54bf79946f"><span offset-key="7067927dbaf1421f9d108f54bf79946f:0">Polarity: Some capacitors are manufactured so they can only tolerate applied voltage in one polarity but not the other. This is due to their construction: the dielectric is a microscopically thin layer of insulation deposited on one of the plates by a DC voltage during manufacture. These are called electrolytic capacitors, and their polarity is clearly marked.</span></span>

<span key="ddb4f1dc95744cc1b07b650e9fc64033"><span offset-key="ddb4f1dc95744cc1b07b650e9fc64033:0">Reversing voltage polarity to an electrolytic capacitor may result in the destruction of that super-thin dielectric layer, thus ruining the device. However, the thinness of that dielectric permits extremely high values of capacitance in a relatively small package size. For the same reason, electrolytic capacitors tend to be low in voltage rating as compared with other types of capacitor construction.</span></span>

<span key="66f9362538d84ec0b6dd41d63080fbeb"><span offset-key="66f9362538d84ec0b6dd41d63080fbeb:0">Equivalent circuit: Since the plates in a capacitor have some resistance, and since no dielectric is a perfect insulator, there is no such thing as a "perfect" capacitor. In real life, a capacitor has both a series resistance and a parallel (leakage) resistance interacting with its purely capacitive characteristics:</span></span>

<span key="d53606dea298429ea6cfc75102c6a0c3"><span offset-key="d53606dea298429ea6cfc75102c6a0c3:0">Fortunately, it is relatively easy to manufacture capacitors with very small series resistances and very high leakage resistances!</span></span>

<span key="06299d3f31bc4130bfd970d3e15686b4"><span offset-key="06299d3f31bc4130bfd970d3e15686b4:0">Physical Size: For most applications in electronics, minimum size is the goal for component engineering. The smaller components can be made, the more circuitry can be built into a smaller package, and usually weight is saved as well. With capacitors, there are two major limiting factors to the minimum size of a unit: working voltage and capacitance. And these two factors tend to be in opposition to each other. For any given choice in dielectric materials, the only way to increase the voltage rating of a capacitor is to increase the thickness of the dielectric. However, as we have seen, this has the effect of decreasing capacitance. Capacitance can be brought back up by increasing plate area. but this makes for a larger unit. This is why you cannot judge a capacitor's rating in Farads simply by size. A capacitor of any given size may be relatively high in capacitance and low in working voltage, vice versa, or some compromise between the two extremes. Take the following two photographs for example:</span></span>

<span key="33c0f7c696984d8c9aaf98dea5bff707"><span offset-key="33c0f7c696984d8c9aaf98dea5bff707:0">This is a fairly large capacitor in physical size, but it has quite a low capacitance value: only 2 ÂµF. However, its working voltage is quite high: 2000 volts! If this capacitor were re-engineered to have a thinner layer of dielectric between its plates, at least a hundredfold increase in capacitance might be achievable, but at a cost of significantly lowering its working voltage. Compare the above photograph with the one below. The capacitor shown in the lower picture is an electrolytic unit, similar in size to the one above, but with very different values of capacitance and working voltage:</span></span>

<span key="29283cea86df4552b385c5f08cacadb3"><span offset-key="29283cea86df4552b385c5f08cacadb3:0">The thinner dielectric layer gives it a much greater capacitance (20,000 ÂµF) and a drastically reduced working voltage (35 volts continuous, 45 volts intermittent).</span></span>

<span key="0c28c1e62e4645a292c5869fb5336ee9"><span offset-key="0c28c1e62e4645a292c5869fb5336ee9:0">Here are some samples of different capacitor types, all smaller than the units shown previously:</span></span>

The electrolytic units have their negative (-) leads distinguished by arrow symbols on their cases. Some polarized capacitors have their polarity designated by marking the positive terminal. The large, 20,000 ÂµF electrolytic unit shown in the upright position has its positive (+) terminal labeled with a "plus" mark. Ceramic, mylar, plastic film, and air capacitors do not have polarity markings, because those types are nonpolarized (they are not polarity sensitive).</span></span>

Take a close look at the following photograph -- every component marked with a "C" designation on the printed circuit board is a capacitor:</span></span>

<span key="fee3f1fc6df1484ebcef0268886861a7"><span offset-key="fee3f1fc6df1484ebcef0268886861a7:0">Some of the capacitors shown on this circuit board are standard electrolytic: C30 (top of board, center) and C36 (left side, 1/3 from the top). Some others are a special kind of electrolytic capacitor called tantalum, because this is the type of metal used to make the plates. Tantalum capacitors have relatively high capacitance for their physical size. The following capacitors on the circuit board shown above are tantalum: C14 (just to the lower-left of C30), C19 (directly below R10, which is below C30), C24 (lower-left corner of board), and C22 (lower-right).</span></span>

<span key="d3293a3b538743399b31ee9807b73f79"><span offset-key="d3293a3b538743399b31ee9807b73f79:0">Examples of even smaller capacitors can be seen in this photograph:</span></span>

Following component labeling convention, the capacitors can be identified by labels beginning with the letter "C".</span></span>
